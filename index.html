    <h2>See the Raptor in it's Natural Habbitat!</h2>
    <p>The F-150 Raptor is the new American badass and it’s also a 2017 10 Best winner. A 3.5 liter twin-turbo V6 makes 450 hp and 510 lb-ft; it pairs with a 10-speed automatic. Rated at 18 mpg highway, it’s more efficient than previous model if that matters to buyers. More important: It hits 60 mph in 5.1 seconds. Standard all-wheel drive, which features a locking center diff, can auto-shift to the rear wheels depending on drive mode. SuperCab and SuperCrew models are offered.</p>
